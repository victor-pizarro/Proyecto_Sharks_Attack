## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to combine what I learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas and see how they all work together. For this project, I will start with this messy data set Shark Attack from Kaggle.

The data will be cleaned up and prepared for analysis with my data wrangling skills.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks

TO DO LIST
- Decide hypotheses with which i will clean the data.
- Explore, manipulate and clean the data.
- Create at least two graphs.

To do this project I used:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Python's libraries: pandas, numpy, regex, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
